    "1.  **Setup:** Run the initial setup cell to install necessary tools and configure your API key.\n",
    "2.  **Upload:** Upload your video or content file(s).\n",
    "3.  **Generate:** Run the subsequent cells to generate different types of metadata based on your uploaded content.\n",

    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "* A Google Account (to use Colab).\n",
    "* A Gemini API Key. You'll need to add this as a Colab Secret."
